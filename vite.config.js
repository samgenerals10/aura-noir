/**
 * Converted from TypeScript → JavaScript on 2026-02-16.
 * Learning notes:
 * - All TypeScript types/interfaces were removed (JS doesn’t use them).
 * - Runtime logic is unchanged; UI/Tailwind classes should render exactly the same.
 * - Read the inline comments around state, effects, handlers, and data flow.
